You’ve been asked to lay the groundwork for one aspect of the new app that relies on code being executed when a message is received from any number of outlets. To do this, you’ll need to establish a Cloud Pub/Sub topic and then create an example Cloud Function that uses the topic as a trigger. Naturally, you’ll need to confirm the Cloud Function has successfully executed.

You’ll need to accomplish the following steps to complete your task:

Enable APIs.
Create Pub/Sub topic.
Create Cloud Function.
Publish message on topic.
Confirm Cloud Function executed via logs.
Trigger directly via the command line.
Confirm Cloud Function executed via logs.
Send message to topic from command line.
Confirm Cloud Function executed via logs.
Note: In addition to the lab mentioned libraries, use the API Library to find and enable the Cloud Build API. The Cloud Pub/Sub console is now found under Analytics, Pub/Sub. When creating the "acg-pubsub-function" function, make sure to expand out the "Runtime, build, connections and security settings" section, and set the "Maximum number of instances" to 1.

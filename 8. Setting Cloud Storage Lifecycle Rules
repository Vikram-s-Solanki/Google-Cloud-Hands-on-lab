Your entire company is looking for ways to lower expenses, and you’ve been asked to set up a series of Cloud Storage lifecycle rules for a particular bucket. These rules will move the objects within the bucket from a Standard storage class to Nearline after one month, then to Coldline after a quarter, then to Archive after a year, and finally to delete the objects after two years — with the exception of one object, which will be placed on an event-based hold. You decide to use both the console and the command line to accomplish these goals.

You can find files for this lab in the cloud-storage-lifecycle-lab folder of the lab repo.
